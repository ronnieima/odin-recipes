        <h2>Easy to make Japanese Curry!</h2>

        <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes.</p>
        <p>The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
	        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
