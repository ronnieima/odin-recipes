        <h2>Oishi Chahan</h2>

        <p>This is a quick and easy all-in-one meal...has rice, meat, and vegetables.</p>
        <p>If you want a little more meat, you can match it up with some chicken teriyaki or grilled barbecue ribs...yum!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup minced carrot</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced green beans</li>
            <li>1 medium white onion, minced</li>
            <li>3 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups cooked white rice</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¾ cup soy sauce (such as Kikkoman®), or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium-low heat. Saute carrots, green beans, onion, and garlic in the hot butter until onions are transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef to the vegetables and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly and carrots are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add rice and mix well.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into a bowl and beat using a fork. Mix into rice mixture until egg is no longer runny, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in soy sauce. Taste and add more soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix rice well. When you're satisfied with the seasoning, turn off the heat and serve.</li>
        </ol>
